	/**
	 * Create a new argument parser for the command. To instance this we need an array
	 * containing the specification explaining how options and arguments are parsed.
	 * 
	 * Each of the keys can be formatted like:
	 * 
	 * 1. A single dash followed by a single character (like -v)
	 * 2. Two dashes followed by an arbitrary number of characters (like --working-dir)
	 * 
	 * Each of the values of the spec can contain the following
	 * 
	 * 1. A string (this is a redirection / alias to another argument - something like -v and --verbose)
	 * 2. An array with the following keys
	 *  - `required` (whether the application should fail if the argument is not available)
	 *  - `type` (is an enum of bool, number and string - performs verification, bools are assumed to be flags)
	 *  - `multiple` (optional - allows the user to use this multiple times, if true the value will always be an array)
	 *  - `description` (explains what the argument is good for)
	 * 
	 * The system will automatically extract operands. Operands are all strings that satisfy one of the following
	 * conditions:
	 * 
	 * 1. They appear after a double-dash (--) operator
	 * 2. They are not immediately preceeded by a non-boolean operand and do not start with a hyphen
	 *

	 * @param string[] $argv
