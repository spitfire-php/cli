/**
 * A progress bar is useful to render a visual indication of the status of a
 * long running task, without making the output too verbose.
 * 
 * Progress bars behave drastically different depending on whether they have a 
 * TTY available or not. Whenever a TTY is available, the progress bar will be 
 * able to render progress bars that can undo their progress (for example due
 * to a queue becoming longer), they can stretch to the full width of the 
 * terminal and they can display a success message once done.
 * 
 * On the other hand, these features cause log files to explode in size, since
 * they cause the system to append all the control characters, making the file
 * enormous and unnecessarily complicated.
